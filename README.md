This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Scheduled jobs (Inngest cron)

Inngest cron expressions use the standard 5-field format: "minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week" and are interpreted in UTC.

Examples:
- 0 12 * * *  => run daily at 12:00 UTC
- 0 6 * * 1-5 => run at 06:00 UTC Mondayâ€“Friday
- 0 */3 * * * => run every 3 hours at minute 0

In this repo, sendDailyNewsSummary is scheduled with 0 12 * * * which runs once per day at 12:00 UTC. If you need it to run at a local time, convert that local time to UTC and update the cron accordingly.
